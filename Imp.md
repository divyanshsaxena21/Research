# XGBoost

- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Here's how it works in simple terms:

- Decision Trees: It builds multiple decision trees, which are models that make decisions based on certain features of the data. Each tree predicts an outcome.

- Boosting: Instead of building one big tree, XGBoost builds trees sequentially, where each new tree tries to fix the mistakes made by the previous ones. It gives more importance to data points that were misclassified earlier.

- Learning from Mistakes: Each tree is added in a way that improves the model by focusing on the errors made by the earlier trees. Itâ€™s like learning from previous mistakes to get better over time.

- Optimization: XGBoost is optimized to be faster and more efficient, with features like handling missing data, regularization (to avoid overfitting), and parallel processing.

- In short, XGBoost combines multiple decision trees to make predictions, and each tree improves upon the previous one, leading to a highly accurate model.
