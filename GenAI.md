# 🛡️ Guide to Building a Fraud Detection System with GenAI, Blockchain, and Machine Learning

This system detects fraudulent transactions in a blockchain using three main technologies:

- **Blockchain**: We use it to gather transaction data.
- **GenAI**: An AI model (like GPT-4) analyzes the data and evaluates whether transactions are risky or not.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A model that uses this data to learn and detect fraud patterns.

---

## 🚀 Overview of the Process

Here’s how the whole process works in simple terms and how a developer can build it.

---

## 🔗 Step 1: Collect Blockchain Data

### Why?
Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions. We need to collect data from the blockchain to analyze transactions happening between wallets. This helps us understand transaction patterns and detect any unusual activity.

### What to Do:

- Use blockchain APIs like **Etherscan**, **Alchemy**, or **Infura** to access data.
- Fetch details such as:
  - Wallet ID (Sender)
  - Receiver ID
  - Amount
  - Timestamp
  - Memo (if available)
- Store this data in a **CSV** or **database** for further processing.

### Learn:
- Blockchain basics
- Using Python APIs to retrieve data

---

## 📝 Step 2: Generate Transaction Summaries

### Why?
Raw transaction data is hard to interpret. Summaries in plain English make it easier to analyze.

### What to Do:
Generate summaries like:

```python
f"Wallet {sender} sent {amount} tokens to {receiver} at {time}. "
f"The wallet typically sends {avg_amount} tokens per day. "
f"This transaction is {X}% higher than average."
```

- **sender**: The wallet that sent the money.  
- **receiver**: The wallet that received the money.  
- **amount**: The number of tokens transferred.  
- **time**: The exact time the transaction took place.  
- **avg_amount**: The usual amount sent by this wallet.  
- **X%**: How much higher the current transaction is compared to the usual amount.  

> 💡 **Use Pandas**: This Python library helps calculate historical transaction patterns like average amount sent.

---

## 🧠 What to Learn (Step 1–2)

- String formatting in Python.
- Using Pandas for calculating averages and performing time-based data analysis.

---

## 🔍 Step 3: Use GenAI to Evaluate Risk

### 🤔 Why do we need this?

Not all transactions are safe. We need AI to analyze each transaction and detect potential fraud. GenAI (like GPT-4) can understand transaction summaries and return a **fraud risk score**.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

1. **Send Summary to GenAI**

```python
prompt = f"""
Analyze the following transaction and rate the fraud risk from 1–10. 
Also explain in 1 sentence why it's risky or not.

Transaction: {summary}
"""
```

2. **Receive GenAI’s Response**

```json
{
  "risk_score": 7,
  "reason": "Sudden large amount to unknown wallet"
}
```

### 📘 What to Learn

- How to interact with GenAI via an API.
- Basics of **prompt engineering**.

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Convert GenAI Output into ML Features

### 🧠 Why?

To make GenAI's output usable for ML models.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

- Add `genai_risk_score` and `genai_reason` to the dataset.
- Optionally convert `genai_reason` to numerical features using **sentence embeddings** (e.g., via `sentence-transformers`).

### 📘 What to Learn:

- How to use sentence embeddings.
- How to prepare data for ML.

---

## 🤖 Step 5: Train Your Machine Learning Model

### 🧠 Why?

To build a model that can **predict fraudulent transactions**.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

- **Create an ensemble model** using base models + a meta model (e.g., GradientBoosting).

```python
base_models = [...]  # Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
meta_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(...)
```

- Train on blockchain + GenAI features.

### 📘 What to Learn:

- Model training with **scikit-learn**.
- Evaluation with metrics: **accuracy, AUC, F1-score**.

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test & Evaluate the Model

### 🧠 Why?

To validate model performance on unseen data.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

- Evaluate using a test dataset.
- Measure performance:

  - **Precision/Recall**
  - **ROC Curve**
  - **False Positives/Negatives**

### 📘 What to Learn:

- Model evaluation using standard metrics.

---

## 🖥️ Step 7: Add Explainability (Optional UI/Report)

### 🧠 Why?

To build trust in the model by explaining **why** a transaction is risky.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

- Store GenAI explanations with predictions.
- Build a dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Flask**.

> Example Message:
> _"This transaction is 85% risky because it involves sudden activity at midnight to a new wallet."_

### 📘 What to Learn:

- Build simple UIs with **Streamlit/Flask**.

---

## ⚙️ Step 8: Automate and Scale (Future Phase)

### 🧠 Why?

To make the system ready for **real-world, high-volume** usage.

### 🛠️ What a Developer Needs to Do:

- Automate real-time monitoring.
- Periodically retrain model.
- Deploy as an API.
