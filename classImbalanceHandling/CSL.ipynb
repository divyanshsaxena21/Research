    "What is Cost-Sensitive Learning in Blockchain Anomaly Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Context:\n",
    "Blockchain datasets are highly imbalanced - fraudulent/anomalous transactions form a tiny minority of the data. Traditional machine learning models tend to be biased toward the majority class (normal transactions), leading to poor detection of rare frauds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Idea of CSL:\n",
    "Instead of treating all classification errors equally, CSL assigns different misclassification costs to different types of errors:\n",
    "1. False Negatives (missing fraud) are assigned a high cost because undetected fraud leads to financial loss and security risks.\n",
    "2. False Positives (flagging normal as fraud) have a lower cost, though they can cause customer inconvenience.\n",
    "The model training objective is modified to minimize the total misclassification cost, not just the error count.\n",
    "\n",
    "How CSL Helps:\n",
    "By incorporating these costs into the learning process, CSL forces the model to pay more attention to detecting the minority class (fraud/anomaly), improving recall and reducing costly misses."
