    "\n",
    "- Blockchain transactions naturally form a graph structure:\n",
    "    - Nodes represent entities such as wallets, addresses, or smart contracts.\n",
    "    - Edges represent transactions or interactions between these entities, often directed and weighted by transaction volume or frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fraudulent behaviors often manifest as complex, coordinated patterns across multiple nodes and edges (e.g., money laundering chains, mixer services, coordinated attacks).\n",

    "- Traditional tabular data methods fail to capture these relational dependencies and temporal evolution of transaction flows."
